  <h2>Twitter</h2>
  <p>Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages
    known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read those
    that are publicly available. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or
    programmatically via its APIs. Prior to April 2020, services were accessible via SMS.[14] The service is provided by
    Twitter, Inc., a corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[15]
    Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in
    November 2017.[16] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.</p>
  <p>Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of
    that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[17] and the service handled an
    average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[18][19][20] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and
    has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[21] As of Q1 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active
    users.[11] In practice, the vast majority of tweets are written by a minority of users.

  <h2>Facebook</h2>
  <p>Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004
    by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
    Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university
    students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American
    universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active
    users,[2] and ranked fourth in global internet usage.[6] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.</p>
  <p>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and
    smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post
    text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with
    different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger,
    join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages
    they follow.

  <h2>Bing</h2>
  <p>Microsoft Bing (commonly known as Bing) is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its
    origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides
    a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.
  </p>
  <p>Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the
    All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the
    time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called
    "Explore pane") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.[4]
